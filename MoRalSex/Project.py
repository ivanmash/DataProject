# This graph shows us answers to the survey and with their age and sex. As we see in it, in most cases both sides were engaged in oral sex with mutual agreement. Although, as we can see with men, the other significant part initiated it on their own decision, whereas on the women side it is clear, that mutual agreement is in a leading position and many of them didn't have vaginal sex nor anal sex. Moreover, as the age is getting bigger it becomes more likely that people don't remember being engaged in oral sex or didn't participate in it at all.

# ## Hypothesis

# In general, people mostly do anal sex and for them, it is not important, whether they have eye contact or not (especially for men). Moreover, my assumption is that sex is popular during University life and most people do it in the age form 20-40 years. And women are the most interested part in holding such an event.

# It is clear that the most popular sex variant is vaginal sex with straight eye contact.

# ## Conclusion (+ hyphothesis check)

# So, as an overview, my hypothesis was incorrect. Basically, when the mutual agreement occur, it is more likely that both genders will agree to have oral sex. Moreover, eye contact plays a great role in sex, and especially in vaginal sex. The most popular age to have sex is vaginal and the most popular age to hold such an event is 40-45 y.o.
